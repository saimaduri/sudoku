# Sudoku Solver #

![Sudoku](docs/images/solved.jpg "Sudoku")

## Description ##
An augmented reality Sudoku solver made with OpenCV, Python, and TensorFlow.

> Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

The main motivation behind this project was to create a fast, easy-to-use application to automatically solve sudoku problems.

## Running ##
This project requires tensorflow, scikit-learn, and opencv.

Note: There is no need to build the project beforehand, as the digit recognition model is saved and does not need to be retrained. 
```
python3 app.py
